--1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

  --Sql Code :

            select 
                (select count (id) from business) as businessrec,
                (select count (business_id) from hours) as hoursrec,

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
         
ii. Difference 2:

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
